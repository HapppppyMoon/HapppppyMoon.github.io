## Happy, Anywhere, Anytime, Anyway ðŸ˜Š

I'm HappyMoon | Seongjoon Moon, a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at ISR Lab, Korea University.<br>
My research focuses on reinforcement learning-based trajectory generation for safe and efficient navigation.<br>
I am also interested in multi-robot task allocation and pathfinding for cooperative systems.<br>
My goal is to apply these approaches to develop practical solutions for real-world deployment.

### Research Areas
